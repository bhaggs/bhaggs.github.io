I was recently thinking about how to exercise my mind to force myself out of the daily routine and came up with a challenge. Redesign any commonly used object.

This isn&#8217;t a ground breaking concept, but I think it&#8217;s an interesting method to keep yourself thinking and looking at how you interact with objects in your environment.

The redesign is to be quick and dirty, rough sketches, nothing too elaborate&#8211;focusing more on the idea than the delivery. There is no guideline as to what the redesign is to acheive, it may be increased usability, it may just be to look prettier.
