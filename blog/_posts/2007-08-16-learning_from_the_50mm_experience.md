I&#8217;m a photography hobbyist, always have a camera in my bag. I&#8217;ve got lenses that range from 18mm to 135mm in zoom length and they all suit me pretty well&#8211;_still on the look out for an ultra wide but that&#8217;s besides the point_. Every now and then I find myself coming back to my 50mm prime lens (no variable zoom, it is what it is). I can only explain this due to that there is something about working within a specific set of constraints which inspires me. With no ability to stand in place and twist a zoom ring to adjust the frame of my photo, I&#8217;m on my feet a lot more getting closer to objects, standing on whatever is accessible. To put it plainly, I feel that I&#8217;m more creative with my shooting&#8211;less susceptible to that dilemma of [greatness in choice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory#Paradox_of_choice). I have to work with what I&#8217;m given.

Similarly, I find that when designing a user experience, having constraints evokes a more stimulating thought process as you try to maneuver within what is possible. Can it be frustrating, _yes_, but that frustration is the basis of what spurs ideation. When it comes time to design, I&#8217;d rather have the 50mm at hand.
