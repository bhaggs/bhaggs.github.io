Almost 10 years ago a startup screen which my brother Mike and I had designed was featured in the Japanese magazine _Mac People_. When I was approached to have the startup screen featured in the magazine and included on their CD, I had requested that they send me a copy of the issue. Long after my exuberance about being in a magazine at age 15 had passed, having assumed they passed on including our work, a package from Japan filled our mailbox.

My 15 minutes of fame has occurred and I suppose I&#8217;m at liberty to say, _<del>I&#8217;m Big In Japan</del>_ _I Was Big In Japan_.
