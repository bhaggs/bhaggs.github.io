Recently I was asked to speak at the [Mobile Monday](http://mobilemonday-ny.com/) series in New York on the research I had worked on around text entry methods. It&#8217;s nice to see events such as these popping up, as it seems this field is under-represented by the professional design and usability organizations (upa, chi, ixda, etc).

The topic for the Mobile Monday event I spoke at was all about design and usability of mobile devices. Coming from a more research background it was interesting to see the other presenters talking about work which they have done that has actually made it into products.

In addition to the presentations, we participated in a panel discussion talking about our work and more importantly where the mobile field is going. My take is more wireless integration with other devices (watches&#8211;_they&#8217;re coming back_, kiosks, purchasing systems, etc).
