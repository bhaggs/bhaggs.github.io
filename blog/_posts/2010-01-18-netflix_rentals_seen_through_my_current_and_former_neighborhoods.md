The New York Times recently took a look at [Netflix user&#8217;s movie queues based on zip code](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/01/10/nyregion/20100110-netflix-map.html). An interesting comparison is to see how this data breaks down between the places I&#8217;ve lived, Boston, New York City, and San Francisco.

Strong commonalities between the three, but clearly Bostonians are more in it for the comedy and pop films. NYC and SF: You really loved &#8220;Rachel Getting Married&#8221; that much?
