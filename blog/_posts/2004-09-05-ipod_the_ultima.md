More often than not I find myself feeling that my [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ "Learn more about the iPod") knows what kind of mood I&#8217;m in. As an avid user of the _Random_ feature I leave the DJing up to my iPod and it continually impresses me by its track selection.

While I know the random feature works entirely by mathematics I am frequently shocked at how well the iPod comes up with a musical set which is tailored to my mood and activity.

Obviously I have selected what music goes on my iPod but out of the over 3,000 songs I have stored on it right now they cross many genres. Yet it&#8217;s almost as if the iPod knows what I want to listen to&#8211;it brings me up and takes it low.

**My iPod is the ultimate DJ.**
