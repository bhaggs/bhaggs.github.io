[<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/post-road-pumpkin-ale.jpg" alt="Post Road Pumpkin Ale" class="image-right" border="0" height="137" width="150" />](http://www.brooklynbrewery.com/beers.asp?OID=18 "Learn more about Post Road's Pumpkin Ale.")I recently picked up Post Road&#8217;s [_a [Brooklyn Brewery](http://www.brooklynbrewery.com/ "The Brooklyn Brewery web site") brand_] [Pumpkin Ale](http://www.brooklynbrewery.com/beers.asp?OID=18 "Learn more about Post Road's Pumpkin Ale."). I had sought to find an uncommon beer, something that was not the standard ale fare of today&#8217;s beers. Lately I have found myself craving the award winning Harpoon [Winter Warmer](http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/beers/harpoon/winterwarmer.htm "Learn more about Harpoon's Winter Warmer"). I don&#8217;t know if it is due to that I am burnt out on Sam Adams&#8217; Summer Ale or if I am just ready for Fall to come.

Alas, let me discuss the bouquet of flavor which is the Post Road Pumpkin Ale.

#### Tasting the Beer

In order to review the Post Road Pumpkin Ale I&#8217;ll use the [Beer Advocate&#8217;s](http://www.beeradvocate.com "Learn more about Beer") _[How To Taste Beer](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/taste.php "Learn for yourself what the proper way to taste beer is")_ guide.

**Color**: A rich dark caramel color with hints of orange.

**Aroma**: A solid pumpkin aroma with a dose of spices akin to those in the Winter Warmer, such as nutmeg and cinnamon.

**Taste**: Probably one of the smoothest beers I&#8217;ve had in a long time. The flavor lacks a hoppy bitter after taste but supplies a bold pumpkin kick. There are also sweet hints which round out the overall changing leaves and crisp air feeling like beer.

If by chance you come across a six pack of Post Road&#8217;s Pumpkin Ale it&#8217;s worth the extra buck or two over your _120_ pack of Bud Light.
