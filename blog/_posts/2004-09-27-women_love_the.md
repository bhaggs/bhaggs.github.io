Why has the iPod mini become such a success when all the technology pundits hailed it an instant failure when Apple announced it?

### Why the Technology Pundits Were Wrong

The majority of those commenting on technology are men. I myself questioned Apple&#8217;s decision with the iPod mini. It looked cool but the price and capacity just were not enticing to me. There in lies where the failure speculation occurred, like me, other men saw the same faults. But we all seemed to forget that not just gadget geeks use these devices.

### Why Women Love the iPod Mini

If you look at the shopping trends of women you can see that functionality is not always their top priority. This is not to say that the iPod does not have top notch functionality but that aspects such as battery life and hard drive capacity take a much lower priority than aesthetics.

The iPod mini is the ultimate digital accessory. It is compact enough to fit in a purse and comes in a variety of colors allowing for a more individually tailored component.
