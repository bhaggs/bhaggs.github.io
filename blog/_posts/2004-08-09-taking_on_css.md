It seems that more and more people are showing some interest in learning <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> but don&#8217;t seem to know where to get useful information about it. There&#8217;s a lot out there, and you can spend a few hours searching Google just to find out that you haven&#8217;t learned much.

[Whitespace](http://9rules.com/whitespace/ "Visit Whitespace") has posted an [article](http://9rules.com/whitespace/design/learning_css.php "Whitespace Article: Learning CSS") with a lot of good resources on how to get into using CSS and XHTML and even what to do after you think you&#8217;ve mastered the two. If you&#8217;re seriously looking to make the jump from 1997 to today check out the provided resources from Whitespace.
