Tomorrow, Neera and I will be heading out on a multiple destination trip in the sunny state of California. While the intended purpose for visiting is to attend a wedding, we have turned the trip into a reason to go on vacation.

Our first California destination is the city of San Francisco. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of great things about the city and surrounding areas. As a fan of transit systems I&#8217;m definitely interested in checking out the BART and the touristy old time trolleys. In fact, we&#8217;ll be riding public transportation to the [Anchor Brewery](http://www.anchorbrewing.com/) for a guided tour of their uniquely San Franciscan brewery. Luckily we&#8217;ll have a local, one of Neera&#8217;s college friends, showing us around.

The trip to San Francisco is also serving as a taste test in some ways for me, as I am determining whether it is a city I would like to work in.

From San Francisco we&#8217;ll be heading down the _Pacific Coast Highway_ to L.A. (where the wedding is being held). Our plan is to do it in two days and make it a relaxing scenic drive.

I&#8217;m not sure what to expect from L.A. The comments from those I know who have visited never have anything good to say about the city. But I&#8217;ll give it the benefit of the doubt until I experience it myself. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get a chance to meet up with my cousin who is living there&#8211;possibly providing me with the details of the cooler places to visit.
