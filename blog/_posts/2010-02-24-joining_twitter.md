Almost 3 years ago I posted my first tweet while on a trip to Washington DC.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">
  <p>
    Sitting in a hotel in DC about to look for some delicious Thai food.
  </p>

A somewhat inane first tweet, and I&#8217;m happy to say that I did actually find that delicious Thai food.

Twitter&#8217;s early simple premise of sharing what you&#8217;re doing with friends has evolved to become a communication platform with seemingly boundless potential, which is yet to be fully realized. And that is why I&#8217;ve decided to join Twitter as part of their [mobile](http://twitter.com/twittermobile) team.

My time at LinkedIn has been filled with great successes and it was a privilege to work with some amazing people.
