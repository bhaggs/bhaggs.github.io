Earlier I had [spoken](http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/09/this_years_ux_book_same_as_last_years.php) about what I had thought about the state of current user experience books and that if I am seeking to find new knowledge I would have to look elsewhere. Oddly enough that elsewhere may be in the past. Which as I write this, seems utterly obvious but I think Alex Wright sums it up nicely in his book [Glut](http://alexwright.org/glut/):

<blockquote cite="http://alexwright.org/glut/">
  <p>
    &#8220;For all the barrels of ink and billions of pixels spent chronicling the rise of the Internet in recent years, however, surprisingly few writers seem disposed to look in any direction but forward.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>

We owe a lot to those who came before us and I&#8217;ll be perfectly honest, I cannot say I know a great deal about those who laid down the path, which is the basis for my career today. The work of these visionaries or futurists when looked at today, the hits are amazingly accurate and the misses well, while amazingly interesting have yet to come to fruition.

But this makes me wonder, are we more caught up in the day after today? As opposed to, who is laying the ground work for that true tomorrow? Yes, working day to day is an iterative process and you&#8217;ll get anywhere one step at a time. Some of the works of earlier futurists describe ideas which are far beyond anything they ever had, and I&#8217;m not talking about looking at a bird and envisioning all humans in [flying cars](http://paleo-future.blogspot.com/2007/06/going-to-opera-in-year-2000-1882.html). So where are today&#8217;s futurists? I assume it is only negligence on my behalf to find them, hopefully.
