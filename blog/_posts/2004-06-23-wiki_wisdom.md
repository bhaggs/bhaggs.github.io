I spend a lot of time reading and browsing through lots of information on a daily basis and often feel that much of this information is lost due to management and organizational issues. Bookmarks don&#8217;t provide the necessary capabilities to really organize information. A lot of times I feel like I want to catalog everything I know so that I can easily refer back to it for a refresher. Unfortunately as of now my best cataloging tool is google. I&#8217;ll punch in bits of what I remember in hopes of finding some obscure information. That kind of strategy wastes a lot of time and is not an absolute guarantee. This got me to thinking about a searchable archive of my own knowledge.

Michael Angeles at urlgreyhot has posted a [discussion](http://urlgreyhot.com/drupal/node/view/1513 "Learn more about personal knowledge management") on using wikis for personal knowledge management. Being that wikis are fairly light weight this could be what I&#8217;m looking for to begin cataloging information which I find could be useful in the future.
