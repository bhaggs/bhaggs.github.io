I&#8217;ve been a BlackBerry Pearl user for only a short while, almost a year. It has its merits but my next phone probably won&#8217;t be another BlackBerry. There are more than a few quirks, but one that has always got me is so simple to solve that it seems weird it has been overlooked for so long.

The Pearl was Research In Motion&#8217;s, maker of the BlackBerry, first entrance into the multimedia phone space which includes a camera and audio, video playback&#8211;all types of media which require a fair amount of memory. With limited storage, it is not uncommon to want to know how much space you&#8217;ve got left on the Pearl&#8217;s **64 megabytes** of internal memory, or **65142784 bytes** as my BlackBerry prefers to tell me.

In a time where we are beginning to even forget about kilo-bytes it truly seems baffling that Research In Motion would even present the memory total and usage in bytes. I studied computer science and even I don&#8217;t want to spend the time deciding whether I want to divide that number by _1024_ or _1000_ to get a better idea in today&#8217;s terms of how much memory I got left.
