As a Mac-using freshman in 2000 at Northeastern University&#8217;s [College of Computer & Information Science](http://www.ccis.neu.edu), I was pretty much a joke to everyone&#8211;mostly due to my computer, but okay, that could be debated. The all too often question was, &#8220;how are you gonna do computer science on a Mac?&#8221; Surprisingly, I did just fine, and before I knew it, a lot of people were picking up on the Mac trend. By the time I graduated a lot had changed in the Mac world and surprisingly, I actually knew a **handful** of other people who owned Macs.

But when I saw the below photo taken by [Mollie Sterling](http://www.molliesterling.com/blog/?p=218) of a classroom at her alma mater, The Missouri School of Journalism, I was more than shocked. I knew there was an up-tick in Mac usage but I certainly never imagined something like this. Even if it was staged or if having a Mac is a prerequisite, it is still an amazing sight.
