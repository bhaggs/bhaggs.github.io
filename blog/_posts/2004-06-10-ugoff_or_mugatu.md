 <img alt="Ugoff and Mugatu" src="/blog/images/ugoff-mugatu.jpg" width="200" height="112" border="0" class="image-right" />Lately there has been a big buzz over the new ad campaigns from Burger King. From what I&#8217;ve read their new ad agency is looking to tap into the professional 20-something market. While I don&#8217;t eat a lot of fast food I will say I like how they are diversifying themselves from the likes of McDonalds and Wendy&#8217;s.

But back on topic, BK&#8217;s latest ad spot features a very Mugatu (Will Ferrell in _Zoolander_) like character, even down to the personality and body language. While I do find this a bit of a rip off I somewhat enjoyed the spot. The character in this case is named [Ugoff](http://www.ugoff.com "Check out Ugoff's site") and he features his own site much like the subservient chicken did.

> The 20-somethings love stuff online and love sending their friends links to stuff like this and put it in their [blogs](http://www.losingcontext.com "yes even I have fallen for their marketing ploy").
