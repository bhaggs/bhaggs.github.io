The <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> format has many merits for its use&#8211;standardized formatting, easy production and publishing. But it seems that today it is being abused as a means of bypassing having to write a web page formatted in <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>. More and more frequently I see companies forgoing this task of writing a web page and just tossing up their content in a downloadable PDF file. It is now so prevalent on the web that search engines such as [Google](http://www.google.com) have opted to add PDF content to their index.

When I worked at [Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu) we frequently had clients ask us to just publish PDF versions of their Word documents because they didn&#8217;t want to foot the bill for us to convert it to a web page. Much of the time it was just a client liaison who didn&#8217;t want to spend more money but was told the information needed to be online. I can not fault them for not knowing how PDF files severely [affect the user experience](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010610.html "Jakob Nielsen discusses the PDF problem").

Organizations and/or web teams need to create and enforce a policy on the proper use of PDF files on the web. This is becoming a rampant problem which instead of attempting to promote awareness and manage it we are succumbing to defeat and poorly adapting to it.
