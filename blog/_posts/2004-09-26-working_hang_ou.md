With the Fall semester of school already underway you can probably tell by the lack of updates that I have been inundated with work. Currently I&#8217;m working on a few projects which include a fair amount of writing; pleading for grant money and asking for acceptance to conferences.

So I have found myself lately hanging out at various places doing work because at my apartment there are just too many distractions. So I just felt that I should give thanks.

**Espresso Royale Cafe**

And my soon to be new home: **[Penguin Pizza](http://www.penguinpizza.com/ "Learn more about what Penguin Pizza has to offer")**
