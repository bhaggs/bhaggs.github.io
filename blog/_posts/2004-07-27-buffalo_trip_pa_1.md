[<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/niagara-falls.jpg" alt="Niagara Falls" class="image-right" border="0" height="113" width="200" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bhaggs/tags/niagara/ "View my photos from Niagra")Got a little recap of the tail end of my trip to Buffalo, NY. Myself, Neera, and her mom headed up to Niagara Canada to check out Niagara-on-the-Lake, the [Butterfly Conservatory](http://www.niagaraparks.com/nature/butterfly.php "Learn more about the Butteryfly Conservatory"), and the Falls at night.

It was good to see some of the other aspects of the Niagara area since I had already seen the Falls previously. The Butterfly Conservatory was an amazing sight to see. They&#8217;re tough to get a picture of unless if you have a high speed camera.

The Falls at night were definitely beautiful but everything seemed so candy coated with all the colored lights beamed onto the Falls. I can only imagine what coming across these falls were like before all the commercialization.

I took a few photos which can be seen in the **[photo gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bhaggs/tags/niagara/ "View my photos from Niagara")**.
