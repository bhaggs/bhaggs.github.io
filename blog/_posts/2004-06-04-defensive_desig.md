[<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/defensive-design-book.jpg" alt="Defensive Design for the Web" class="image-right" border="0" height="195" width="150" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/073571410X/qid=1086381686/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-5906890-8409700?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Check out 'Defensive Design for the Web' at Amazon")I recently picked up [37signals](http://www.37signals.com "Visit 37Signals web site") new book _Defensive Design for the Web_. The book offers some good insight into some of the more basic usability design issues on the web and while it is a quick read I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to the more advanced designers. If you&#8217;re new to web design or finally realizing that there is more to creating web pages than just html this book is probably a good read.

I do still think that I will use it as a reference in my library of books. _Defensive Design for the Web_ does one thing that most usability design books don&#8217;t and that is showing bad design. Many books out there exclaim how they are not writing a book to scold designers but to laud those which are designed well. Unfortunately that doesn&#8217;t always help because as humans we learn from mistakes and showing bad design helps us learn what not to do.

If you do get a chance to pick this up I highly recommend getting Steve Krug&#8217;s book _Don&#8217;t Make Me Think_ as well since his book I feel makes a great companion to _Defensive Design for the Web_. Krug&#8217;s book shows a lot of great design and a lot great ways to make them even better which is something that the 37Signals book does not do.
