[<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/unkle-nnl.jpg" alt="UNKLE - Never, Never, Land" class="image-right" border="0" height="150" width="150" />](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=27505231&originStoreFront=143441 "Check out this album on iTunes") UNKLE&#8217;s latest album, which apparently took me awhile to get, goes in a new direction in comparison to the first album which featured DJ Shadow as a major player. [_Never, Never, Land_](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=27505231&originStoreFront=143441 "Check out this album on iTunes")&#8211;masterminded by James Lavelle, Richard File, <del>DJ Shadow</del>&#8211;utilizes many pianos and strings which give it an almost trip-hop like feel. Much like UNKLE&#8217;s first album, _Psyence Fiction_, there is an assortment of guest artists who make up many of the vocals on the tracks.

This is the type of album that when you play it on your [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ "You should have one of these already")&#8211;during your travels&#8211;everything around you takes on this surreal feeling. Especially while listening to the minimalist [_What Are You To Me?_](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?selectedItemId=27505196&playListId=27505231&originStoreFront=143441 "Listen to this song on iTunes") or the epic of strings [_Reign_](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?selectedItemId=27505202&playListId=27505231&originStoreFront=143441 "Listen to this song on iTunes").
