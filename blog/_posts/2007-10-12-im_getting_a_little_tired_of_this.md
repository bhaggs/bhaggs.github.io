Every music artist samples in some way, that&#8217;s no surprise. Typically it&#8217;s better to sample from songs that aren&#8217;t just a few years old. No one remembers the old stuff, thus it can be called current. When Kanye West sampled Daft Punk&#8217;s &#8220;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&#8221; for his song, &#8220;Stronger&#8221;, it was a stretch as the Daft Punk version only came out 6 years prior and Daft Punk has been on the road with their Alive 2007 tour, greatly featuring their version of the song.

The Alive 2007 tour, an amazing spectacle of a concert, featured some of the most advanced visuals I&#8217;ve seen. One of the most enchanting visuals was the red light up suits worn by the Daft Punk duo (seen below left).

If you&#8217;re wondering, that&#8217;s Kanye West on the right in his _blue_ light up jacket from his &#8220;Stronger&#8221; performance on _Saturday Night Live_. It is one thing to sample a riff, but to also sample a concert which is still currently going on is a whole other matter.
