The guys over at 37Signals always seem to come up with some good work. Their latest topic is about implementing [_Epicenter Design_](http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000737.php "Learn more about Epicenter Design"). Which they describe as:

<blockquote cite="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000737.php">
  <p>
    Epicenter design involves focusing in on the true essence of the page (the â€œepicenterâ€) and then building outwards.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Many times I feel that as designers we lose sight of the main goal of a particular page. We get so wrapped up in creating the right color scheme or layout that the true purpose of the page is lost. The _Epicenter Design_ approach revolves around maintaining the goal of a page during the design process.

I realize that sometimes this can&#8217;t always be done due to the constraints of the marketing team, the company president, or even the manager of the project. But I think that even at the least keeping the ideologies of _Epicenter Design_ in mind while designing will improve the usability of any page.
