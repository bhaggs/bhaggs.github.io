I have often felt that a great user experience can be defined by the little things. They&#8217;re the elements of an interface which pop up just when you need them and disappear when you don&#8217;t.

A nice example of this, is one I noticed today while using [Google&#8217;s News Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) application. There is a subtle feature which by clicking a little arrow, minimizes the navigation pane to allow for more screen space for news content. It&#8217;s easy to miss, but it&#8217;s really a minor feature I think only a few people will truly take advantage but certainly a useful one to have.

Its subtly unfortunately can open a door to confusion, if a user were to accidentally click the little arrow. The user unaware of what has occurred, is left with an interface missing a major navigational element. But Google handled this issue with a _little thing_&#8211;a simple speech bubble informing the user upon the first time they use the feature that it is in minimized mode. And from then on, it _disappears_&#8211;there just when you need it and gone when you don&#8217;t.

#### What We Can Lean From This Example

Examples such as these display the difference between simply meeting a set of functional requirements and making a great user experience. When it comes to timelines and budgets, sadly these little things are the first to go. It can certainly be a battle to get the little things included, but as this example shows, it is a battle worth taking on.
