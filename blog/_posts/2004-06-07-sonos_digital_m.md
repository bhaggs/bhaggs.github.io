I am constantly listening to music where ever I am and having the ability to have your entire library of music throughout your house is just unbeatable. I don&#8217;t live in a big house and as of right now the system is only available for pre-order at $1200.

The controller for the system has a very iPod-like sleekness which from an asethetics point of view gives me the impression that the device would be a joy to use. The UI also looks to be very easy to use but only a test of the unit will determine that.

On the technical specs one of the things I found to be a definite plus is that it supports AAC which is what I am encoding all my new music in.
