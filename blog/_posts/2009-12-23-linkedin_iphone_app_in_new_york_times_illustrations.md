It&#8217;s always a pleasant surprise to find our app icon for the [LinkedIn iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin/id288429040?mt=8) showing up in different places. Recently it has been popping up in illustrations [[1](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/technology/06apps.html), [2](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/business/22apps.html)] for articles in the New York Times.
