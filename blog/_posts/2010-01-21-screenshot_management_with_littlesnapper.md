[LittleSnapper](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/) is another tool I can&#8217;t live without. I frequently use it to capture and tag screenshots of my own work and designs from others for inspiration. Screenshot organizer, full web page capture, and non-destructive annotations make it that much superior to Mac OS X&#8217;s built-in screenshot feature.
