<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-icons.gif" alt="MyNeu Icons" class="image-right" border="0" height="201" width="291" />In user interface design icons play a major role, as they provide the user with a simple visual cue intended to easily convey the meaning of a feature or action at a glance. Icon design in web applications is especially paramount as web users typically scan pages as opposed to actively reading them. The choice of icons can greatly affect how users interact with a web application and ultimately the usability of such an application.

The recent design update of [MyNeu](http://www.myneu.neu.edu/ "Visit MyNeu") brings a new set of icons for the web application&#8217;s utility navigation (Email, Calendar, My Account, Logout, and Help). Unfortunately these new icons are a step backwards for MyNeu and I&#8217;ll take a look at each one to examine the pros and cons.

#### Email

The _email_ icon luckily has not varied much since the previous design. The icon of an _envelope_ has become a fairly common standard on the web as a representation for email.

#### Calendar

Typically we see _calendar_ icons represented by their physical form, that of the wall-hanging or desk calendar. The previous MyNeu design used such an icon but the new design takes a more disconnected approach by using an icon with the representation of a _sun_. This breaks away from the standard conventions we see on many other major sites such as _Yahoo!_ or _MSN_. When using standard conventions the user has less to learn about how to use a particular site and in turn increases the ease of use. MyNeu took a major step backwards on this one and failed to capitalize on what users already know.

#### My Account

There are times when it can be difficult to represent a feature in a simplified icon representation and _My Account_ is one of those times. The previous design represented the feature with an icon of a _key hole_ which in many ways is a fairly close mapping to the feature&#8217;s function, that of changing your account&#8217;s password. The new design utilizes an icon representation of a _treasure chest_ which unfortunately is severely lacking in comparison to the _key hole_&#8216;s mapping.

#### Logout

MyNeu&#8217;s previous design showcased a _lock_ as its icon representation for _logout_ which provided the user the with a mapping of security when clicked. The new design has one of the worst icon representations I have ever seen, that of a _pinwheel_. It can be said that this icon provides the user with **ZERO** help as to what its function is. In more cases it probably hinders the user&#8217;s perception of the site as he looks for the logout feature.

#### Help

The _question mark_ is without a doubt one of the most common web conventions used in representing _help_. Luckily MyNeu managed to carry that icon over from their previous design.
