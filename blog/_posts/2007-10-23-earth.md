Photographs of our planet are so commonplace to many of us that we don&#8217;t even really think about it. Imagery of our planet has always existed in my lifetime. It was only recently that I even thought to realize that in my father&#8217;s own lifetime, photographs of our planet from space did not exist. The first photograph of Earth from space was taken by the Explorer 6 satellite in 1959. My dad was 8 years old at the time.
