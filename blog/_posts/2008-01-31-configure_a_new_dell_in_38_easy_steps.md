Can&#8217;t afford that new [MacBook Air](http://apple.com/macbookair/)? In just **38 easy steps** you can get yourself setup with a new [Dell](http://dell.com) laptop instead.

Dell has forgone attempting to provide the user with a simple ordering process in favor of countless upsells. The extra &#8220;components&#8221; Dell asks the user to configure range from what Adobe, QuickBooks, and TurboTax software to install to decking out the laptop with a carrying case, external mouse, and printer. While at it, throw in a matching flash drive. Don&#8217;t forget warranty, accident insurance, and premium tech support. With all this extra stuff, the user probably won&#8217;t be able to install it himself&#8211;throw in that in-home install and setup.
