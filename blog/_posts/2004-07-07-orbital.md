[<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/orbital-blue-album.jpg" alt="Orbital - Blue Albm" class="image-right" border="0" height="150" width="150" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00029KZMM/qid=1089213901/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-3742080-8461500 "Check out the Blue Album at Amazon")I&#8217;ve long been a fan of [Orbital](http://www.loopz.co.uk/ "Visit the Orbital site") and after _The Altogether_ I was somewhat disappointed with what Orbital had been putting out. When I heard that their next album would be their last I was hoping that they could redeem themselves.

The _Blue Album_ is definitely a good farewell as it touches upon the progression of their sound over the years. Tracks such as _One Perfect Sunrise_ and _You Lot_ are just pure Orbital of old but with a bit of an updated feel.

With the end of Orbital I totally regret missing them perform live. But at the least I have an extensive collection of their work over the years. Tracks like _The Box_ and _Halcyon and on and On_ are what got me into electronic music.
