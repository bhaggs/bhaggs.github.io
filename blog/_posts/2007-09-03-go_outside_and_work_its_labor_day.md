On today&#8217;s semi-mandatory day off in America, [Labor Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_day), I thought it would be nice to take a look at that nice [New York Times graph](http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/magazine/05wwln-lede-t.html) comparing the number of mandatory days off in many of the top industrialized countries.

No surprise here, us Americans seem to think even a little mandatory paid time off is too much. Yes, that&#8217;s right even today&#8211;the day to honor us hard working Americans is not truly mandatory. So stuff another hot dog down your throat and flip on the TV cause there&#8217;s nothing to worry about.
