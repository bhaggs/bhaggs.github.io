[Northeastern University&#8217;s](http://www.neu.edu) [College of Computer and Information Science](http://www.ccs.neu.edu) [<acronym title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</acronym> Research Lab](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/hci/), a lab I&#8217;m a part of, is headed off to Portland, OR for the [<acronym title="Computer-Human Interaction">CHI</acronym>](http://www.chi2005.org) conference to present some of our most recent research work. Aside from attending the presentations and networking with colleagues, hopefully I&#8217;ll get a chance to check out the [Portland](http://www.travelportland.com/) area.

#### What is CHI and What are We Doing There?

<blockquote cite="http://www.chi2005.org/">

[Peter Tarasewich](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/tarase/), [Jun Gong](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gjoliver/), and I will be presenting our work on text entry methods for mobile devices:

  * [_Alphabetically Constrained Keypad Designs for Text Entry on Mobile Devices_](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/tarase/p109Gong.pdf "Download the paper in PDF format") (PDF)
  * [_An Enhanced Multitap Text Entry Method with Predictive Next-Letter Highlighting_](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/tarase/lbr278-gong.pdf "Download the paper in PDF format") (PDF)

Additionally, my colleague, [Andrea Grimes](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/agrimes/), will be taking part in a workshop on Social Implications of Ubiquitous Computing. Primarily looking at privacy concerns in the mobile context.

#### Portland, OR

[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) provides a [pictorial view](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/portland/) of Portland which I&#8217;ll be adding to during my visit.

I&#8217;m still in the processing of deciding what sights and areas I want to explore. Unfortunately according to the weather forecast for next week, it&#8217;s going to be raining for the extent of my trip.

The developing agenda includes visiting some local breweries and [Japanese gardens](http://www.japanesegarden.com/), possibly taking part in a [walking tour](http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com/) of Portland.

#### The Hotel

I&#8217;ll be staying at the [Red Lion Hotel](http://www.redlion.com/WHC/Hotels/ShowHotel.asp?ID=187) which is in close proximity to the convention center. [A9](http://www.a9.com) provides a [less glamorous view](http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0004QNNOA/104-3538773-4900768?%5Fencoding=UTF8&node=3999141) of the hotel.

#### Job Searching

With graduation approaching in just under a few weeks, I&#8217;m in the process of searching for a full time job. CHI should be a great opportunity for me to network with others from my field, as well as get a chance to speak with some [great companies](http://www.chi2005.org/geninfo/recruiting.html "See what companies will be recruiting at CHI").

#### What&#8217;s to Come

Throughout the conference I&#8217;ll be reporting on the events, posting pictures, and most importantly enjoying a long over due trek out of Boston.
