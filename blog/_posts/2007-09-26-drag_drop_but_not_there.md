Dragging and dropping files on a Macintosh has almost always felt limitless&#8211;drag a file onto an application in the dock, over a folder, onto a window, and things just work as you&#8217;d expect.

Living the dual life that I have&#8211;Mac at home, Windows at work&#8211;I often run into oddities between the two operating systems. While a long time Mac user I use my Windows computer more frequently so we can rule out the idea that I&#8217;m just too used to the Mac.

I recently attempted to take an action which I expected no resistance, dragging a JPG onto the Photoshop icon in my task bar. My thinking was that I wanted to open this file in Photoshop and what better a way than to simply drag and drop. Certainly would save me the time of clicking on Photoshop, selecting _Open_ from the _File_ menu and then navigating to the file&#8217;s location.

The error message I received was odd in that its tone came off almost as if they knew what I was doing was certainly what any normal person would try to do. So instead of doing what I needed, it gave me some instructions on their way of doing it. It&#8217;s strange due to that the only action which could take place, would be to open the file. Had I wished to drop the file into a particular window I would have done so.
