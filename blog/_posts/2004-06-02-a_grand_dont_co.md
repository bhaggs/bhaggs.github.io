<img src="/blog/images/the-streets-a-grand.jpg" alt="The Streets: A Grand Don't Come for Free" class="image-right" border="0" height="150" width="150" />I recently picked up the new Streets album and decided I&#8217;d give everyone my take on the album. While in many ways I do think the album format is dead, _A Grand Don&#8217;t Come for Free_ definitely makes you think otherwise. The flowing story through tracks makes you want to listen to the album from start to finish whenever you listen. Ok well ya I don&#8217;t always listen to the entire album everytime but in theory you should.

On a side note Neera and I will be seeing The Streets live at Avalon at the end of this month. I&#8217;ll be sure to post some photos. It seems that I only take photos at Streets concerts.
