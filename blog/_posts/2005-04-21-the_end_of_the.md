Today I finished my last exam of my undergraduate career. Next Saturday, my five years at [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu) will culminate with graduation at the Boston Garden (formerly the FleetCenter). Where I will go from here, is still very much in the air&#8211;industry, academia, New York, California, or just staying right here.

#### A Brief Look Back

In the fall of 2000, when I brought that first cart load into [Stetson West](http://www.housing.neu.edu/see_stetsonW.html), 2005 seemed a great ways off. Much like today, seeing the banner for &#8220;Welcome Class of 2010&#8221; seems like a far off time. I look at this picture of me taken for COM1121 (freshman intro class for Co-Op) and am shocked at how young I feel like I look&#8211;considering how these past five years seem like such a blur at this point. (For comparison here is a [recent photo](/about/index.php))

My three years at [Harvard](http://www.uis.harvard.edu) as a Co-Op, while great times, are quickly moving further away. It is odd to think that it was a year ago that I left.

The strangest part of graduating is knowing that I will have no real need to come back to campus. This campus has evolved so much and continues to do so that when I do come back to visit I&#8217;ll probably barely recognize anything. But hopefully I&#8217;ll return for the christening of the _Haggerty Usability Lab_, a joke my HCI lab friends always made.

#### What&#8217;s Next

Throughout my college career, I was never truly free of obligations. With the Northeastern schedule I was either in classes or on Co-Op year round. Even last summer I took on some freelance work to fill my days. It is a bit exhilarating knowing that I am out of the Northeastern routine. But now, I&#8217;m left with the daunting task of discovering my career path.
