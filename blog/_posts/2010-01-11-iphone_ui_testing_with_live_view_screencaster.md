One of my essential tools while designing user interfaces for the iPhone is [Live View Screencaster](http://www.zambetti.com/projects/liveview/), which allows me to broadcast in real-time a 480&#215;320 portion of my Mac screen to a wi-fi connected iPhone. This allows for immediate visual verification on the physical device. The app can also pass through touch events allowing for the possibility to create simple prototypes.

My friend [Aaron](http://www.facebook.com/aaron) turned me on to this app and it&#8217;s been at the top of my list of every day tools since.
