 <img src='http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/macbook-magsafe.jpg' alt='MacBook with MagSafe' class="image-right" />I can&#8217;t tell if I have a predisposition to sitting with walls to my right, but I seem to consistently find myself in that awkward position of trying to overextend my MacBook&#8217;s power cable to connect it the left side of my MacBook. Often the power cable is just too short or gets disconnected due to the _MagSafe_ connector detaching as I pull it tight in an attempt to compute comfortably.

My first inclination was that due to the annoyance of this situation, I was perceiving it to occur more frequently than it actually was. But when I began to keep this mind, I was noticing this issue each time I plugged in: at the office or on my couch. Maybe I&#8217;ve set up all the spaces I work within backwards. I think it seems to come down to MacBook [Feng Shui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui).
