Recently I left JPMorgan Chase and New York City, to try my hand at a new locale and job. Back when I completed school, I had that cliche decision to make, New York or San Francisco&#8211;why not both. After three years in New York, it was time to give San Francisco a go. Seeking to work on more publicly facing internet products, the decision to head for the bay area was easy.
