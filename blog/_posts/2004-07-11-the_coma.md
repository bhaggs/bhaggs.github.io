[<img alt="The Coma" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/the-coma.jpg" width="150" height="236" border="0" class="image-right" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573222739/qid=1089573630/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-3742080-8461500 "Check out 'The Coma' at Amazon")Just read Alex Garland&#8217;s _[The Coma](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573222739/qid=1089573630/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-3742080-8461500 "Check out 'The Coma' at Amazon")_ which not surprisingly was an ultra quick read. The book clocks in at about 200 pages with a good amount of illustrations and double spaced text.

That aside I&#8217;ll say it was still a good read. _The Coma_ plays almost like a dream analysis in terms of what make up our dreams, the setting, characters, and events. Garland constructed the book in much the way that dreams feel to me, the sudden change in scenery or the appearance of unfamiliar people as major characters. Upon finishing the book you realize that Garland leaves the story very open ended, much like a dream, so it&#8217;s up to you to decipher the story as you feel.
