But what is worse is that this process has continued for many years without any redesign of the walker.</p><p>Granted, new walkers such as those with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002U24QG/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_f/102-3901696-8086568">hand brakes</a> do exist to answer the shortcomings of the traditional walker. But, the tennis ball solution is a simple one, one which I feel could be easily reincorporated into the traditional walker. These people are just looking for a little bit of traction and the ability to easily slide their walkers. Not to mention the difficulty in slicing a hole in a tennis ball. Do medical supplies stores sell tennis balls to go along with the purchase of a walker?</p><p>This design shortcoming has even been taken advantage of as a business oppurtunity, the <a href="http://www.specialty-medical.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=WB-Gray&amp;Category_Code=walkers-guardian&amp;Product_Count=17">Walkerballs</a>.</p><br></article></main></div><div id=footer-container><footer id=footer><ul id=contact-links><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/bhaggs.xyz title="Find me on Bluesky">@bhaggs.xyz</a></li><li><a href=https://threads.net/bhaggs title="Find me on Threads">@bhaggs</a></li><li><a rel=me href=https://macaw.social/@bhaggs title="Find me on Mastodon">@bhaggs@macaw.social</a></li><li><script type=text/javascript>emailE="bryan@bryanhaggerty.com",document.write('<a href="mailto:'+emailE+'" title="Find me by Email">bryan@bryanhaggerty.com</a>')</script></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty title="Find me on LinkedIn">linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty</a></li><li><a href=http://bhaggs.xyz title="You've already found me">bhaggs.xyz</a> &mdash; <em>you're here</em></li></ul><p id=credits>Site built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
