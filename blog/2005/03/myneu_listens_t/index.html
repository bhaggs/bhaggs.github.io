It sounds like an obvious idea, but it is not always commonly done. Luckily it seems that <a href=http://www.neu.edu>Northeastern University</a> is getting closer to realizing the benefits of such a method.</p><p>Over the course of two years I have identified some key areas of Northeastern’s <a href=http://myneu.neu.edu><em>MyNeu</em></a> student portal system which I felt were hindering the overall user experience (readings available in the <a href=#related-links title="Read other articles I've written about this topic">Related Links</a> section). I had mailed my original research paper to Northeastern’s Information Services department in hopes of creating a dialogue to discuss ways to improve the <em>MyNeu</em> user experience. Nothing came of my efforts so I ultimately left it at that.</p><p>Recently <em>MyNeu</em> sought input from its users about the services they were providing–what new features to add, how to improve existing ones. I saw this as an opportunity to provide them with my thoughts on one of their most troubling areas, <em>Co-Op Services</em>. Much of my comments were drawn from my article titled, <a href=http://www.losingcontext.com/blog/2004/06/myneu_things_ha.php><em>MyNeu: Things Have Only Gotten Worse</em></a>. Harsh, but I truly believe this was a major fumble on their behalf. Luckily it seems that this time my comments were heard and action was taken. To preface this, figure 1 shows what the <em>Co-Op Services</em> section previously looked like. Providing equal screen real estate for Co-Op information from each college, when the user is really only in need of the information from their one respective college.</p><p class=figure-centered><a href=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-co-op.php title="View this screenshot in full size"><img src=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-co-op-thumb.gif alt="MyNeu Co-Op Services with previous design" height=375 width=400></a><br>Figure 1. <em>Original Co-Op Services section design</em> [<a href=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-co-op.php>View Full Size</a>]</p><p>Based upon my comments stating how <em>MyNeu</em> should provide their users with information relevant to their specific needs (i.e., the information from their college), Figure 2 displays the updated version.</p><p class=figure-centered><a href=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-co-op-updated.php title="View this screenshot in full size"><img src=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-co-op-updated-thumb.gif alt="MyNeu Co-Op Services Section with updated design" height=369 width=400></a><br>Figure 2. <em>Updated Co-Op Services section design</em> [<a href=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/myneu-co-op-updated.php>View Full Size</a>]</p><p>While this is my last semester at Northeastern, I hope that maybe my work can turn both users and developers to look more deeply into ways of improving the user experience of Northeastern’s offerings.</p><p id=related-links><strong>Related Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=http://www.losingcontext.com/portfolio/myneu/>MyNEU portfolio entry</a></li><li><a href=http://www.losingcontext.com/blog/2004/06/myneu_things_ha.php>MyNeu: Things have only gotten worse</a></li><li><a href=http://www.losingcontext.com/blog/2004/10/myneu_problems.php>MyNeu: Problems with Icon Design</a></li></ul><br></article></main></div><div id=footer-container><footer id=footer><ul id=contact-links><li><a rel=me href=https://macaw.social/@bhaggs>@bhaggs@macaw.social</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/bhaggs>@bhaggs</a></li><li><script type=text/javascript>emailE="\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0068\u0061\u0067\u0067\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0079\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d",document.write('<a href="mailto:'+emailE+'">\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0068\u0061\u0067\u0067\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0079\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d</a>')</script></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty>linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty</a></li><li><a href=http://bhaggs.xyz>bhaggs.xyz</a> &mdash; <em>you're here</em></li></ul><p id=credits>Site built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
