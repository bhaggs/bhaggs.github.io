Ballmer had attributed it to poor marketing but Spoolsky hits it on the head, it’s not about marketing but about the saturation of computers. Everyone has a PC and we’re doing just fine with the current version of Word. In the early days people were buying new computers more frequently or even just buying their first. Those new machines came with the latest and greatest software from Microsoft. Unfortunately today people aren’t buying new computers as frequently, especially companies. Thus that new software isn’t getting into the hands of users.</p><p>My number one application on my computer is <a href=http://www.apple.com/safari/ title="Check out Apple's Safari">Safari</a>, my web browser. That says a lot about where things are going, as if many people haven’t already realized that. I use more web-based applications than I do rich client software. I’m writing this post in a web-based application. Web applications will get better and I think with projects like <a href=http://www.whatwg.org/>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> that is a good start. Eventually our web apps will look and work more like regular applications, look at Apple’s <a href=http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html>Dashboard</a> technology which is based on open web standards.</p><br></article></main></div><div id=footer-container><footer id=footer><ul id=contact-links><li><a rel=me href=https://macaw.social/@bhaggs>@bhaggs@macaw.social</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/bhaggs>@bhaggs</a></li><li><script type=text/javascript>emailE="\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0068\u0061\u0067\u0067\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0079\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d",document.write('<a href="mailto:'+emailE+'">\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0068\u0061\u0067\u0067\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0079\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d</a>')</script></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty>linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty</a></li><li><a href=http://bhaggs.xyz>bhaggs.xyz</a> &mdash; <em>you're here</em></li></ul><p id=credits>Site built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
