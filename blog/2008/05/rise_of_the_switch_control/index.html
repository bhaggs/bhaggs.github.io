As such, the <em>switch</em> control is a cleverly appropriate control, due to that as the user operates the switch he can see the state of the control, without removing the finger from the screen.</p><p>What is interesting to see is the influence which this control type is having on user interfaces–ones that are not on the iPhone or even on touch-screen devices. Apple itself, took this over sized control and implemented it in its new <a href=http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html>Time Machine</a> preference pane in Mac OS X Leopard. Adobe implements it in its photo management application, <a href=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/>Lightroom</a>, as a means of toggling photo development options</p><p class=figure-centered><img src=http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/time-machine_lightroom.jpg alt title=time-machine_lightroom width=476 height=301><br>Left: <em>Apple Time Machine</em>, Right: <em>Adobe Lightroom</em></p><h4 id=switches-in-web-applications>Switches in Web Applications</h4><p class=figure-right><img src=http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/powerset_brightkite-258x300.gif alt title=powerset_brightkite width=258 height=300><br>Top: <em>Powerset</em>, Bottom: <em>Brightkite</em></p><p>The switch control is also making its way into web applications. <a href=http://www.powerset.com>Powerset</a>, a new entrant in the search field, utilizes the switch control as a toggle between a wikipedia article’s table of contents and a more expanded view of the article’s sub-sections.</p><p><a href=http://www.brightkite.com>Brightkite</a>, a location based social network, uses the switch as a preference control to indicate the privacy level of who can see your current location.</p><p>The switch does not provide any control that couldn’t be gained from using a select list, radio buttons, or even tabs, but it does offer a stronger visual state, one which is akin to the commonly known light switch. But like a light switch and many other physical switches, they are limited in what they can convey (i.e., on and off). Powerset’s use of the switch control certainly pushes the boundaries of how the control should be used.</p><p>The switch control is something to keep an eye out for.</p><br></article></main></div><div id=footer-container><footer id=footer><ul id=contact-links><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/bhaggs.xyz title="Find me on Bluesky">@bhaggs.xyz</a></li><li><a href=https://threads.net/bhaggs title="Find me on Threads">@bhaggs</a></li><li><a rel=me href=https://macaw.social/@bhaggs title="Find me on Mastodon">@bhaggs@macaw.social</a></li><li><script type=text/javascript>emailE="bryan@bryanhaggerty.com",document.write('<a href="mailto:'+emailE+'" title="Find me by Email">bryan@bryanhaggerty.com</a>')</script></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty title="Find me on LinkedIn">linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty</a></li><li><a href=http://bhaggs.xyz title="You've already found me">bhaggs.xyz</a> &mdash; <em>you're here</em></li></ul><p id=credits>Site built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
