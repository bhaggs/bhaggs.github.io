For the most part just a trip to hang out, get out of Boston, and for her to visit home. The big thing on my mind is the wings though. You would think that the wing recipe could be replicated, but none can come close to authentic <em>Buffalo Wings</em>.</p><p>Our itinerary is pretty much non-existant, which is totally fine with me. Although we are thinking we might head up to Toronto for a day.</p><p>While on our travels I may drop a post about what’s happening out in <em>B-Flo</em>.</p><p><em>Note: I was hard pressed to find any kind of photo that represented Buffalo.</em></p><br></article><article class=entry><h2><a href=http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/the_new_age_of/ rel=bookmark title="Permanent Link to 'The new age of software development'">The new age of software development</a> <em class=publish-information>07/16/2004</em></h2><p>I’ve come across a few good articles which I think are worth reading if you are interested in software development and in particular how rich client programming is declining as web client programming is increasing.</p><p>Joel Spolsky has written a lengthy analysis of <a href=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html title="Read Joel's article">How Microsoft Lost the API War</a>. It definitely opened my eyes a bit as it discusses some of Microsoft’s missteps and just plainly how the industry is changing.</p><p>The Guardian discusses the <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1260994,00.html title="Read The Guardian's article">New Browser War</a>, which ties in very well with Spoolsky’s commentary.</p><h4 id=some-real-world-observations>Some real-world observations</h4><p>My roommate Kevin had told me about how Steve Ballmer was upset that people and companies were not buying the latest version of Office. Ballmer had attributed it to poor marketing but Spoolsky hits it on the head, it’s not about marketing but about the saturation of computers. Everyone has a PC and we’re doing just fine with the current version of Word. In the early days people were buying new computers more frequently or even just buying their first. Those new machines came with the latest and greatest software from Microsoft. Unfortunately today people aren’t buying new computers as frequently, especially companies. Thus that new software isn’t getting into the hands of users.</p><p>My number one application on my computer is <a href=http://www.apple.com/safari/ title="Check out Apple's Safari">Safari</a>, my web browser. That says a lot about where things are going, as if many people haven’t already realized that. I use more web-based applications than I do rich client software. I’m writing this post in a web-based application. Web applications will get better and I think with projects like <a href=http://www.whatwg.org/>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> that is a good start. Eventually our web apps will look and work more like regular applications, look at Apple’s <a href=http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html>Dashboard</a> technology which is based on open web standards.</p><br></article><article class=entry><h2><a href=http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/up_up_down_down/ rel=bookmark title="Permanent Link to 'Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Select Start'">Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Select Start</a> <em class=publish-information>07/13/2004</em></h2><p>People seem to be going 8-bit crazy these days. From people like <a href=http://www.bitshifter.cc/ title="Check out the sounds of Bit Shifter">Bit Shifter</a> to <a href=http://www.nullsleep.com/ title="Check out the sounds of Nullsleep">Nullsleep</a>. I’ll admit I get into it and enjoy these 8-bit masterpieces but nothing beats the originals from the games themselves, that is until they were put onto the back drop of some breakbeats.</p><p>Saskrotch has put out <em><a href=http://barnofhell.com/saskrotch.htm title="Download the album">Nintendo Breakz Volume One</a></em>, a collection of 40 classics remixed. The Megaman (Rockman) 2 remix has really got me going right now. Totally has a 1992 early hardcore feel. The Bubble Bobble remix is almost happy hardcore like with 4-4 stompyness.</p><br></article><article class=entry><h2><a href=http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/the_coma/ rel=bookmark title="Permanent Link to 'The Coma'">The Coma</a> <em class=publish-information>07/11/2004</em></h2><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573222739/qid=1089573630/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-3742080-8461500" title="Check out 'The Coma' at Amazon"><img alt="The Coma" src=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/the-coma.jpg width=150 height=236 border=0 class=image-right></a>Just read Alex Garland’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573222739/qid=1089573630/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-3742080-8461500" title="Check out 'The Coma' at Amazon">The Coma</a></em> which not surprisingly was an ultra quick read. The book clocks in at about 200 pages with a good amount of illustrations and double spaced text.</p><p>That aside I’ll say it was still a good read. <em>The Coma</em> plays almost like a dream analysis in terms of what make up our dreams, the setting, characters, and events. Garland constructed the book in much the way that dreams feel to me, the sudden change in scenery or the appearance of unfamiliar people as major characters. Upon finishing the book you realize that Garland leaves the story very open ended, much like a dream, so it’s up to you to decipher the story as you feel.</p><br></article><article class=entry><h2><a href=http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/orbital/ rel=bookmark title="Permanent Link to 'Orbital&amp;#8217;s Blue Album'">Orbital&amp;#8217;s Blue Album</a> <em class=publish-information>07/07/2004</em></h2><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00029KZMM/qid=1089213901/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-3742080-8461500" title="Check out the Blue Album at Amazon"><img src=/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/orbital-blue-album.jpg alt="Orbital - Blue Albm" class=image-right border=0 height=150 width=150></a>I’ve long been a fan of <a href=http://www.loopz.co.uk/ title="Visit the Orbital site">Orbital</a> and after <em>The Altogether</em> I was somewhat disappointed with what Orbital had been putting out. When I heard that their next album would be their last I was hoping that they could redeem themselves.</p><p>The <em>Blue Album</em> is definitely a good farewell as it touches upon the progression of their sound over the years. Tracks such as <em>One Perfect Sunrise</em> and <em>You Lot</em> are just pure Orbital of old but with a bit of an updated feel.</p><p>With the end of Orbital I totally regret missing them perform live. But at the least I have an extensive collection of their work over the years. Tracks like <em>The Box</em> and <em>Halcyon and on and On</em> are what got me into electronic music.</p><br></article></main></div><div id=footer-container><footer id=footer><nav id=pagination><ul><li><a href=/blog/page/21/ class=next>Older</a></li><li><a href=/blog/page/19/ class=previous>Newer</a></li></ul></nav><ul id=contact-links><li><a href=https://twitter.com/bhaggs>@bhaggs</a></li><li>bhaggs.eth</li><li><script type=text/javascript>emailE='\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0068\u0061\u0067\u0067\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0079\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d',document.write('<a href="mailto:'+emailE+'">\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0079\u0061\u006e\u0068\u0061\u0067\u0067\u0065\u0072\u0074\u0079\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d</a>')</script></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty>linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty</a></li><li><a href=http://bhaggs.xyz>bhaggs.xyz</a> &mdash; <em>you're here</em></li></ul><p id=credits>Site built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
