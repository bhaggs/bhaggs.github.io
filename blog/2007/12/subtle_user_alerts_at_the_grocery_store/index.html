It is about providing information when it is needed but also not disrupting the work flow. When done right, it’s almost a natural assumed experience–seamless.</p><p>I was reminded of this in an unassuming place, not on a computer but at the grocery store. There are far more interactions at play in grocery stores than is often realized. In particular, in a grocer’s produce section where they seek to provide customers with fresh from the farm vegetables, the produce is kept clean and fresh by misting water on the produce–hopefully when a customer is not picking out vegetables.</p><p>In the past there used to be a person who would mist the produce with a water hose but today this process is mostly automated. But with the grocery store employee gone, customers don’t know when this misting is going to occur. The method employed to alert these customers of the misting, to possibly stand clear for a moment, is subtle but maps to a metaphor which <strong>requires no language</strong>, just an understanding of nature. Moments before the misting occurs the noise of a thunder storm rolls through. Thus informing the customer of the approaching rain showers, or mist in this case.</p><p>There are no spinning lights, bells, or muffled voices from a speaker to harshly grab the customer’s attention. Those are the obvious, thoughtless, and likely distracting methods. The thunder storm alert masterfully achieves its purpose unobtrusively of informing the customer but also plays into the whole experience of fresh produce, by pulling in other elements of nature.</p><br></article></main></div><div id=footer-container><footer id=footer><ul id=contact-links><li><a href=https://threads.net/bhaggs title="Find me on Threads">@bhaggs</a></li><li><a rel=me href=https://macaw.social/@bhaggs title="Find me on Mastodon">@bhaggs@macaw.social</a></li><li><script type=text/javascript>emailE="bryan@bryanhaggerty.com",document.write('<a href="mailto:'+emailE+'" title="Find me by Email">bryan@bryanhaggerty.com</a>')</script></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty title="Find me on LinkedIn">linkedin.com/in/bryanhaggerty</a></li><li><a href=http://bhaggs.xyz title="You've already found me">bhaggs.xyz</a> &mdash; <em>you're here</em></li></ul><p id=credits>Site built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
