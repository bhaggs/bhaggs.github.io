On Saturday, July 30th, I will be leaving Boston on a one-way trip down to New York City. Next week I start my new job at JPMorgan Chase in Midtown Manhattan.

At [JPMorgan Chase](http://www.jpmorganchase.com) I will be working as a user interface designer and information architect within the Global Credit Risk Management division (that sounds so much more complex in writing). I will be the fourth member of the User Experience group. From what I have gathered from my conversations and meetings with them they are very friendly and chill people&#8211;much like how I see myself.

Starting work could not have come at a better time. Most recently I have been missing that stimulation I get when I design and write. While I have enjoyed my time off, getting back into a creative atmosphere will surely be welcomed.

But before I can get back to working I need to move. Having lived in the same apartment for the past three years I, luckily, have avoided the stress of moving. Prior to my current place, my roommates and I moved quite frequently. Each time when we moved we cleaned house by dumping all the junk we&#8217;ve accumulated. The unfortunate side of not moving often is the glut of junk I have built up. Therefore, I&#8217;m left with the daunting challenge of determining what junk I want to throw away and the junk I want to keep. It is somewhat comical how I have stuff I keep that I only come across when I move.
