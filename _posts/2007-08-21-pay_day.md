It&#8217;s apparently a good time to be the CEO, according to [Portfolio.com](http://www.portfolio.com/infographics/2007/06/salary_comparison). Most recently CEOs have been making 465 times the salary of their average worker. Compared to only 28 times in 1970.

I think this sums up the response to that age old interview question of where you want to be in 5, 10, or 15 years.
