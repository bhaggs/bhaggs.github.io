Since my term ended at [Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu) my time in the [Harvard Square](http://www.harvardsquare.com "Get information about happenings in the square") area has dropped off significantly. Recently I ventured back through to meet up with some old co-workers. I was literally floored by what I saw. Harvard Square is becoming so commercialized and now exists mainly as a marketing tool for companies.

The Boston area banks have destroyed the culture of Harvard Square by invading its every space. Upon walking out of the [MBTA](http://www.mbta.com) station you have access to six full service banks all within eyeshot. It&#8217;s not about taking in the history and atmosphere of Harvard, it&#8217;s about taking in the brand.

The compiled map shows the Harvard Square locations of _Bank of America_, _Citizens Bank_, _Sovereign Bank_, _Cambridge Savings Bank_, and _Cambridge Trust Company_.
