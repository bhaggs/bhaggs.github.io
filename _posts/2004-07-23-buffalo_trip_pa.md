After a nasty rainstorm and a bit of traffic we finally arrived in Buffalo.

Today we headed into the city and got some _chicken finger subs_, a Buffalo speciality, and cruised around the city. I&#8217;ll give Buffalo credit for one thing, its got a lot of unique shops, something that is quickly fading away in Boston. Granted many of these shops only offered womens trinkets (candles, soaps, etc.).

I also got to check out Buffalo&#8217;s subway system in some degree. Unfortunately it is not something to write home about, but since I dig transit systems I will. Pretty much it has stops in the all the places you don&#8217;t want to go. From what I can gather the people are afraid of the thing. If you bring a subway stop to a thriving area, it will kill it.
