It&#8217;s Sunday afternoon, there are clear skies with a high of 92&#176;. A bit hot for my tastes but I&#8217;ve had a good weekend. I am looking forward to taking a shower, watching some TV, and getting some work done on the computer. Only to arrive home and discover that I was robbed.

I expected my arrival at my apartment to be no different than any other time I&#8217;ve come home after staying over at Neera&#8217;s place. This time around it began just like that&#8211;nothing seeming out of the ordinary, Moz (my cat) hanging out in the living room, some stuff moved about due to Kevin moving. It wasn&#8217;t until I walked into my bedroom that I was a little tweaked out. Some of my drawers were pulled out&#8211;meanwhile I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Man, if you need some stamps or something at least close the drawer.&#8221; Then I notice my PowerBook is gone. Still, at this point I have this feeling that maybe someone was using it in the living room or something.

This is the point where if this was a story being told on _[This American Life](http://www.thislife.org)_ the music would stop and there would be a short pause, then I say:

> And then I turned around&#8211;back door wide open, window screens smashed out, and there are flies everywhere. **I&#8217;ve really just been robbed.**

I looked into my roommates&#8217; rooms to see if anything of theirs had been taken. Kevin&#8217;s room has always looked as if a robber came in ransacked the place, with the exception of drawers pulled out. Steve&#8217;s room looked pretty much intact except for the aforementioned pulling out of the drawers.

With shock and disbelief firmly setting in I call Kevin, who by the way is about to have a graduation party, to see if he has his laptop. Unfortunately he was a victim of the smash and grab as well.

#### What They Took

After filing reports with the police it is apparent that we&#8217;ll never know who stole our stuff and we probably will never see it again. What is worse is that I keep discovering more stuff that they stole. Provided below is a list of my items that were stolen:

  * PowerBook G4
  * iPod
  * Canon Digital Camera
  * An older Mobile Phone (formerly Neera&#8217;s)

#### Things to Take Away from this Experience

Things could have been much worse. For one, they could have stolen a lot more. But what really freaks me out is the possibility of being home when someone invades your property.

While this is a horrible experience for me, it is a wake up call. We&#8217;re hyper-vigilant about locking this apartment down, but even that won&#8217;t always prevent the worst from happening. What this violation has taught me is that if you rent an apartment you should get renter&#8217;s insurance. This was always on the back of my mind&#8211;never did it, now I&#8217;m paying for it. Back up your data to an external hard drive, dvd, anything that is not physically attached to the computer. Luckily I did this. The financial loss of my property is far less than if I were to lose my data. If anyone else has some tips I would love to hear them.

Writing this article was tough, cause it only makes me more angry thinking about it. But on a funny side note (meaning it could have been worse), a few hours after the whole ordeal, I realized that Moz was covered in dirt. He&#8217;s an indoor cat mind you. Apparently he ventured outside for awhile, I guess he doesn&#8217;t think my apartment is that bad of a place to live.
