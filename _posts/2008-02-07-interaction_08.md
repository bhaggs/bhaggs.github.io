 <img src='http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ixda-logo.gif' alt='IxDA Logo' class="icon-left" />Tomorrow kicks off the first day of the [IxDA&#8217;s](http://ixda.org) first conference, [Interaction 08](http://interaction08.ixda.org). The sold out event marks a milestone for the young organization, as an all volunteer organization working solely for the community, they have truly brought together a lot of amazing minds. My hat is off to my friends [Dave](http://synapticburn.com), [Liya](http://noreally.wordpress.com/), Nasir, and the many others who have helped put together not only Interaction 08 but the many other IxDA events throughout the years.

**See you in Savannah!**
