I have a pre-paid 30 day subway [MetroCard](http://www.mta.info/metrocard/), which means for 30 days I can swipe my MetroCard and never think about it until that 31st day rolls around and the turnstile tells me &#8220;insufficient fare&#8221;. You hate being that guy holding up the line and hate being behind the guy that that happens to. It slows the entire process down, especially when it&#8217;s the morning rush hour and there are only two turnstiles.

What is surprising is that the turnstiles, shown below, do provide the user with some information, but not much. Although, if you use a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard, turnstiles actually do give you some useful information&#8211;how much money is left on your MetroCard.

Which makes it odd, due to that the turnstiles could provide meaningful information to 30 day MetroCard holders&#8211;when their MetroCard will expire. The display has the space and it obviously does know this information. Instead, users must find out the hard way on that 31st day or swipe their MetroCard at designated card checkers.

Due to that your 30 day MetroCard can start on any day of the month, having that reminder of its expiration every time you swipe at a turnstile, could save you the embarrassment or having to wait in a long line for nothing.
