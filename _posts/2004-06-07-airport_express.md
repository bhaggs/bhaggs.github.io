[<img alt="Apple's Airport Express" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/legacy/airport-express.jpg" width="150" height="127" border="0" title="Get all the specs on Airport Express from Apple" class="image-right" />](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/)Just hours after I posted the entry about the [Sonos System](http://www.sonos.com/) Apple releases [Airport Express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/). The unit is basically an access point but Apple added some really nice features to it. The one that is in reference to the Sonos system is the audio out jack to a stereo. Plug in the unit next to a stereo and plug the line out into the stereo&#8217;s line in. Now in itunes you have the ability to stream music to that access point which in turn plays on the stereo via a feature Apple has dubbed [AirTunes](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/airtunes.html).

The kicker is that the unit is only $129 as opposed to $1200 for the sonos system (granted I am not including the cost of purchasing a mac but it is assumed you have a computer).

Some of the other features include a usb port for hooking up a usb printer and also wireless internet access.

Another great thing I love about some of the Apple products coming out as of late is that they are standardized for the most part. If you own an iPod or a Powerbook you&#8217;ll surely know what I&#8217;m talking about. They have these easily interchangable plugs which can be swapped for the extension cord plug or even to different country plug formats.
