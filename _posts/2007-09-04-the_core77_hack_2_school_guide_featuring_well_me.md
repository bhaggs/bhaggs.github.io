I recently acted as a &#8220;model&#8221; for the [Classmate Designertypes](http://www.core77.com/hack2school/classmates.asp) section in [Core77&#8217;s](http://www.core77.com) [Hack 2 School Guide](http://www.core77.com/hack2school/). I play the part of various stereotypical design students at art school. I think I managed to bring out my inner _Chosen One_, _Dude_, and _Space Cadet_.
