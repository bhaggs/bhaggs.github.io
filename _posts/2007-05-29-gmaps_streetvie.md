Google has just released, _Street View_, its latest feature to the Google Maps product. Essentially an enhanced version of Amazon A9&#8217;s now defunct block view. While impressive, I could not help but notice the lack of image quality of the panoramas. Although surprisingly, it seems this is a New York specific issue.

Shown below are two views of Apple&#8217;s stores in both [San Francisco](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1+Stockton+St&sll=37.785915,-122.406299&sspn=0.001664,0.001896&ie=UTF8&ll=37.786333,-122.406036&spn=0.001664,0.002776&z=19&om=1&layer=c&cbll=37.785821,-122.406221&cbp=1,278.796237348706,0.224027323783593,3) and [New York City](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=767+Fifth+Ave.+new+york+ny&sll=37.786333,-122.406152&sspn=0.001645,0.001658&ie=UTF8&ll=40.764236,-73.973238&spn=0.001576,0.001658&z=19&om=1&layer=c&cbll=40.763939,-73.973264&cbp=1,115.294117647059,0.45281862745098,2); of note is the difference in image quality between the two. San Francisco Street Views also have another additional level of zoom detail.

I cannot envision what Google&#8217;s reasoning is for offering lower quality images of New York&#8217;s streets. My assumption is that identical equipment was used in shooting the panoramas for both cities. Security and privacy seem to be the only logical explanation (i.e., lower quality images mean in a city as populated as NYC you will reveal fewer recognizable faces).

<div class="update">
  <strong>Update:</strong> It appears that Google subcontracted their image capture work for New York out to <a href="http://www.immersivemedia.com/">Immersive Media</a>, while their San Francisco imagery was done in-house. This is solely based off the subtle copyright notice which is displayed in the lower right corner of the Street View image.
