User experience professionals seem to be in fairly good demand it appears. I only say this due to the amount of recruiter calls I receive. Typically 1 every other day. Lately though they have really stepped it up&#8211;calling my mobile phone, calling my office phone (by way of dialing the company switchboard), and emailing me.

Everyone gets the call saying that a friend or colleague had referred them and by the way they want to remain anonymous. But recently I got a call that topped that them all simply by being as ambiguous as possible.
