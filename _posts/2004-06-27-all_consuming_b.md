A few years ago I was telling people how I felt that in the future there would be aggregator services which would search the web&#8217;s blogs and analyze them for topics such as movies, music, or books. I saw this as a way to get real reviews from regular people.

I think we&#8217;re getting closer to that with a service I came across today known as [All Consuming](http://www.allconsuming.net/). I had come across this site from looking at referrers to my site. All Consuming searches through blogs for entries which have links to Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and so forth. These links are what bring the entry into context about a particular book. The web site then aggregates blog entries from tons of sites and you can now look up a particular book and see what people are saying about it on their blogs.

The site features my [entry](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=073571410X "See my entry featured") reviewing _Defensive Design for the Web_.
