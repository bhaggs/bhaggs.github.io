People seem to be going 8-bit crazy these days. From people like [Bit Shifter](http://www.bitshifter.cc/ "Check out the sounds of Bit Shifter") to [Nullsleep](http://www.nullsleep.com/ "Check out the sounds of Nullsleep"). I&#8217;ll admit I get into it and enjoy these 8-bit masterpieces but nothing beats the originals from the games themselves, that is until they were put onto the back drop of some breakbeats.

Saskrotch has put out _[Nintendo Breakz Volume One](http://barnofhell.com/saskrotch.htm "Download the album")_, a collection of 40 classics remixed. The Megaman (Rockman) 2 remix has really got me going right now. Totally has a 1992 early hardcore feel. The Bubble Bobble remix is almost happy hardcore like with 4-4 stompyness.
