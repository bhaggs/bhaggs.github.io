Often I check out what some of the latest UX books have got to offer, always on the lookout to learn more. Unfortunately, recently I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of the same. I picked up Robert Hoekman&#8217;s _Designing the Obvious_ and while well written and containing an abundance of relevant examples, I found that, like many other books on the shelves today, it seemed to be a regurgitation of everyone else&#8217;s books.

I can only take so much of half page pull quotes from the likes of Alan Cooper, Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, and Steve Krug. They&#8217;ve all had very insightful things to say, and that is the issue; I&#8217;ve already read their books. Where am I took to indulge my learning desire?

#### Looking for Inspiration

The bookshelves seem to be a little too much about **The Now** or more appropriately, **The Yesterday**. I won&#8217;t lie, I miss the days of doing research and reading about ideas in their infancy&#8211;at the time questioning their relevance. That is why I was happy to come across a little feature in iTunes called, [iTunes U](http://www.apple.com/education/itunesu/). It is an area in iTunes dedicated solely for universities and the content they want to share with their students and, in my case, the curious public.

Most interestingly are [Stanford](http://itunes.stanford.edu/) and [MIT&#8217;s](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm) offerings. Video lectures on topics ranging from _HCI_ to _Brain Structure and its Origins_. Best of all, they&#8217;re cheaper and more accessible than any book.
