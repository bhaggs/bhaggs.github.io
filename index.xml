And it’s common for those people to willingly put their name on it, taking accountability for what’s great and what needs to be improved.
As teams scale up, the division of work on a product is distributed amongst many more people in splintered teams.</description></item><item><title>Joining Twitter</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2010/02/joining_twitter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2010 15:19:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2010/02/joining_twitter/</guid><description>Almost 3 years ago I posted my first tweet while on a trip to Washington DC.
Sitting in a hotel in DC about to look for some delicious Thai food. &amp;mdash; Bryan Haggerty (@bhaggs) March 21, 2007 A somewhat inane first tweet, and I’m happy to say that I did actually find that delicious Thai food.
Twitter’s early simple premise of sharing what you’re doing with friends has evolved to become a communication platform with seemingly boundless potential, which is yet to be fully realized.</description></item><item><title>Screenshot Management with LittleSnapper</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2010/01/screenshot_management_with_littlesnapper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2010 17:59:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2010/01/screenshot_management_with_littlesnapper/</guid><description>LittleSnapper is another tool I can’t live without.

It has a unique place on the iPhone due to its user’s primary method of interaction–a blunt index finger.
It is not surprising that many of the points of interaction on the iPhone are over sized. Lost, is that precision of a mouse pointer. More importantly, on touch-screens, due to the size of a person’s finger, it can obscure useful information in the interface.</description></item><item><title>Dying Maps and Their Successors</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2008/04/dying_maps_and_their_successors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2008 17:12:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2008/04/dying_maps_and_their_successors/</guid><description>I am a lover of maps.

It’s why electronics stores have rows and rows of TVs, sound proof stereo listening rooms, video game demo stations, and plenty more. Whether the customer makes a purchase or not, he has gotten a taste for that product, which will resonate far more than any product photo or video could.</description></item><item><title>The Voting Experience</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2008/02/the_voting_experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2008 11:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2008/02/the_voting_experience/</guid><description>Getting the chance to take part in the voting process doesn’t come around too frequently. It is why when it does come around, it can sometimes be a difficult process–and I’m not talking about making a decision on which candidate to support. The topic of voting machine usability is often talked about and even the UPA has attempted to take on that challenge. But an even greater part of the voting experience exists in how a voting location is structured and presented and how polling volunteers assist voters.</description></item><item><title>Help Guide for Opening the Vista Box</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2008/02/help_guide_for_opening_the_vista_box/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2008 12:16:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2008/02/help_guide_for_opening_the_vista_box/</guid><description>A customer’s first experience with a product is often its packaging.

Visiting a local bookstore does allow for that browsing of printed material more easily than an online store and some people do take joy in lingering around the vast shelves. But when visiting a bookstore in search of a specific item, the process can be somewhat frustrating and like a treasure hunt–almost making you rather wait the three days to get it by mail.</description></item><item><title>Social Network: Collector&amp;#8217;s Edition</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/12/social_network_collectors_edition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2007 10:12:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/12/social_network_collectors_edition/</guid><description>Speaking with a friend recently about the fickleness of users, we inevitably came to the discussion of social networks and how users simply abandon one for the next.

It is about providing information when it is needed but also not disrupting the work flow. When done right, it’s almost a natural assumed experience–seamless.
I was reminded of this in an unassuming place, not on a computer but at the grocery store. There are far more interactions at play in grocery stores than is often realized. In particular, in a grocer’s produce section where they seek to provide customers with fresh from the farm vegetables, the produce is kept clean and fresh by misting water on the produce–hopefully when a customer is not picking out vegetables.</description></item><item><title>Little Things In UI Can Go a Long Way</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/11/little_things_in_ui_can_go_a_long_way/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2007 15:53:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/11/little_things_in_ui_can_go_a_long_way/</guid><description>I have often felt that a great user experience can be defined by the little things. They’re the elements of an interface which pop up just when you need them and disappear when you don’t.
A nice example of this, is one I noticed today while using Google’s News Reader application. There is a subtle feature which by clicking a little arrow, minimizes the navigation pane to allow for more screen space for news content.</description></item><item><title>Reducing the New York City Subway Map</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/11/reducing_the_new_york_city_subway_map/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2007 11:38:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/11/reducing_the_new_york_city_subway_map/</guid><description>As a New Yorker and avid subway fan, each day I admire the New York City subway map, designed by Michael Hertz. It is certainly a great piece of graphic design and a cultural icon of the city. Its representation of subway lines and geography is burned into many of our heads. I sought to reduce the map to its simplest form, the contouring lines which depict each subway line’s route.</description></item><item><title>Keep To The Right</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/11/keep_to_the_right/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2007 15:17:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/11/keep_to_the_right/</guid><description>I can’t tell if I have a predisposition to sitting with walls to my right, but I seem to consistently find myself in that awkward position of trying to overextend my MacBook’s power cable to connect it the left side of my MacBook.

Typically it’s better to sample from songs that aren’t just a few years old. No one remembers the old stuff, thus it can be called current. When Kanye West sampled Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” for his song, “Stronger”, it was a stretch as the Daft Punk version only came out 6 years prior and Daft Punk has been on the road with their Alive 2007 tour, greatly featuring their version of the song.</description></item><item><title>Apple of My Eye</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/10/apple_of_my_eye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2007 15:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/10/apple_of_my_eye/</guid><description>As a Mac-using freshman in 2000 at Northeastern University’s College of Computer &amp;amp; Information Science, I was pretty much a joke to everyone–mostly due to my computer, but okay, that could be debated.

The Pearl was Research In Motion’s, maker of the BlackBerry, first entrance into the multimedia phone space which includes a camera and audio, video playback–all types of media which require a fair amount of memory.</description></item><item><title>A Lot of Hot Air</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/09/a_lot_of_hot_air/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2007 15:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/09/a_lot_of_hot_air/</guid><description>The majority of computer users use a right-handed mouse, even if you’re a left-handed, the industry has pretty much almost forced you to be a right-handed when it comes to a mouse. Which is why I’ve become a bit baffled by a design decision made by Dell in their laptops.
Laptops are becoming more and more the choice for computing over desktop computers and often people like to hook up a mouse to avoid the usable but straining trackpad.</description></item><item><title>The Core77 Hack 2 School Guide Featuring, well, Me</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/09/the_core77_hack_2_school_guide_featuring_well_me/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2007 21:56:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/09/the_core77_hack_2_school_guide_featuring_well_me/</guid><description>I recently acted as a “model” for the Classmate Designertypes section in Core77’s Hack 2 School Guide.

No surprise here, us Americans seem to think even a little mandatory paid time off is too much.

I won’t lie, it is a fairly common occurrence and an activity I recommend for anyone in the industry. Often my rants are five minute manifestos on why something is designed poorly and what needs to be changed to rectify the situation.
In order to push that agenda for designing more usable products you need to be as mad as hell and let it be known–in the politest manner possible.</description></item><item><title>ByeSpace</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/08/byespace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2007 13:46:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/08/byespace/</guid><description>In the early days it was email and today it’s the online profile. It seems these days that if you don’t have a profile on a social network you don’t really exist, at least in regards to the Internet–even my dad has one.

Every now and then I find myself coming back to my 50mm prime lens (no variable zoom, it is what it is). I can only explain this due to that there is something about working within a specific set of constraints which inspires me.</description></item><item><title>Mac People Japan</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/08/mac_people_japan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2007 19:55:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/08/mac_people_japan/</guid><description>Almost 10 years ago a startup screen which my brother Mike and I had designed was featured in the Japanese magazine Mac People.

But there was a time when the mouse was a new method of interaction and we had to inform people on the mechanics of its operation. In a 1984 Apple brochure for the Macintosh they outlined how to use a mouse and what it could be used for. Reading it today, it sounds like a set of directions for something as pedestrian as a door handle.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Being Ambiguous While Recruiting</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/08/the_art_of_being_ambiguous_while_recruiting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2007 12:05:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/08/the_art_of_being_ambiguous_while_recruiting/</guid><description>User experience professionals seem to be in fairly good demand it appears. I only say this due to the amount of recruiter calls I receive. Typically 1 every other day.

While in school Kevin and I, fond users of the ZipCar service, often joked about the idea of creating a company around the same model but with dogs–ZipDog (aptly named for the assumed buyout offer from ZipCar that was surely to come).
The idea was simple; not many people want to own a dog or can’t due to building rules, but do like to play with them.</description></item><item><title>Stretch Your TV, Stretch Your Web TV</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/07/stretch_your_tv_stretch_your_web_tv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2007 18:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2007/07/stretch_your_tv_stretch_your_web_tv/</guid><description>You almost can’t buy a TV today that isn’t a widescreen, yet the majority of our TV programming is still broadcasted in the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio (square shape) format. But you’ve got that nice widescreen tv so you got to use that all too common stretch feature, which more often than not produces a poor image and is not at all flattering for our favorite celebrities.

The greatest issue with IA portfolios seems to be that an IA can do many different things and as such their deliverables can be an assortment of artifacts.

As is the practice of after printing one, immediately throwing it away.

Through examining ATM environments and the methods in which users interact with ATMs we can gain insightful details, especially around how receipts are used.</description></item><item><title>The Design Challenge</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2006/04/the_design_chal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2006 18:09:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2006/04/the_design_chal/</guid><description>I was recently thinking about how to exercise my mind to force myself out of the daily routine and came up with a challenge. Redesign any commonly used object.
This isn’t a ground breaking concept, but I think it’s an interesting method to keep yourself thinking and looking at how you interact with objects in your environment.
The redesign is to be quick and dirty, rough sketches, nothing too elaborate–focusing more on the idea than the delivery.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Monday New York</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2006/03/mobile_mondays/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2006 19:00:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2006/03/mobile_mondays/</guid><description>Recently I was asked to speak at the Mobile Monday series in New York on the research I had worked on around text entry methods.

Unfortunately this information is now secretly locked behind mystery doors (links) 2 through 34. How can we give the user insight into what lies behind these doors instead of simply choosing at random in order to find they information they desire?
Pagination has helped in reducing the load of information a user has to take in or download for that matter, but the pagination navigation leaves a great deal to be desired.</description></item><item><title>Improving the Tag Cloud Through Color</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/10/improving_the_t/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2005 21:14:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/10/improving_the_t/</guid><description>I know, why are we still talking about tag clouds? The concept is becoming a bit cliche as of late, but they’re still a viable option for presenting information visually.

The users of these walkers have filled a gap in the design to make the walker better fit their needs. But the real question is, why haven’t the designers of the walker taken notice of this very prominent “user hack”.

But as technology advances (eliminating dials in favor of buttons), sayings such as the aforementioned one are becoming irrelevant. This same progression is occurring in the metaphors we use in computing.
When the first graphical user interfaces were being developed the designers sought to ease the learning curve by making the user experience similar to one which they already knew–the desktop.</description></item><item><title>New Job, New People, New York City</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/07/new_job_new_peo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2005 11:11:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/07/new_job_new_peo/</guid><description>On Saturday, July 30th, I will be leaving Boston on a one-way trip down to New York City.

Gap clothing understands this and is tailoring their stores to better fit with what their customers expect to get out of a shopping experience.
In the clothing industry knowing what the customers like and what their methods for shopping are is critical for profitability. In terms of shopping methods, the major unisex stores such as Gap, H&amp;amp;M, and Urban Outfitters pretty much use a one size fits all model for merchandise placement–one which predominantly falls in line with how women shop.</description></item><item><title>Off to California</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/05/off_to_californ/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2005 12:08:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/05/off_to_californ/</guid><description>Tomorrow, Neera and I will be heading out on a multiple destination trip in the sunny state of California.

Especially when looking at the markets for each product. While GMail provided an unheard of, at the time, 1gb of storage, the competition quickly responded. This isn’t to say that GMail didn’t have an assortment of other great features, but with Google Maps they have completely changed the online map paradigm.

Whether it was my PC bashing Mac centric homepage of the mid-90s, the rave fueled Haggs 2.0, or the currently professionally focused Losing Context, I have a history on the Web. With the remodeling of Losing Context I decided to provide a little insight into the past of my time on the Web.
1995 My first foray into the Web should be prefaced with a piece I wrote back in ’96 about learning HTML and my proficiency in making web pages:</description></item><item><title>An Example of Inconsistent &amp;amp; Poor Form Design</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/01/effects_of_inco/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2005 20:32:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2005/01/effects_of_inco/</guid><description>Web applications are becoming more and more prominent, as are the html forms which comprise the method of interaction for these applications. Through the use of a simple example, I’ll discuss some of the good and bad points behind this example’s form design in terms of instructions and form actions. Additionally I’ll cover some tips on how to identify and avoid these problems.
I recently came across a simple example of inconsistent form design at the SallieMae website.</description></item><item><title>Doing More with Photos</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/12/doing_more_with/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2004 20:03:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/12/doing_more_with/</guid><description>There has been a lot of talk about Flickr lately, but what I found the most intriguing is seeing how people are using it. The central component of the service is its ability to allow people to finally share their digital photos in a more easy and natural manner. It is pretty common for me, and many people I know, to take digital photographs and then do absolutely nothing with them.</description></item><item><title>Never, Never, Land</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/11/never_never_lan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2004 17:33:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/11/never_never_lan/</guid><description>UNKLE’s latest album, which apparently took me awhile to get, goes in a new direction in comparison to the first album which featured DJ Shadow as a major player. Never, Never, Land–masterminded by James Lavelle, Richard File, DJ Shadow–utilizes many pianos and strings which give it an almost trip-hop like feel. Much like UNKLE’s first album, Psyence Fiction, there is an assortment of guest artists who make up many of the vocals on the tracks.</description></item><item><title>The Misuse of the PDF</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/11/the_misuse_of_t/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 15:38:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/11/the_misuse_of_t/</guid><description>The PDF format has many merits for its use–standardized formatting, easy production and publishing. But it seems that today it is being abused as a means of bypassing having to write a web page formatted in HTML. More and more frequently I see companies forgoing this task of writing a web page and just tossing up their content in a downloadable PDF file. It is now so prevalent on the web that search engines such as Google have opted to add PDF content to their index.</description></item><item><title>MyNeu: Problems with Icon Design</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/10/myneu_problems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2004 16:04:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/10/myneu_problems/</guid><description>In user interface design icons play a major role, as they provide the user with a simple visual cue intended to easily convey the meaning of a feature or action at a glance. Icon design in web applications is especially paramount as web users typically scan pages as opposed to actively reading them. The choice of icons can greatly affect how users interact with a web application and ultimately the usability of such an application.</description></item><item><title>Bank Square</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/10/bank_square/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2004 19:03:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/10/bank_square/</guid><description>Figure 1. Map of Banks in Harvard Square Since my term ended at Harvard my time in the Harvard Square area has dropped off significantly. Recently I ventured back through to meet up with some old co-workers.

Why has the iPod mini become such a success when all the technology pundits hailed it an instant failure when Apple announced it?

The reasoning is that I hate having to pull out my mobile phone all the time to see who is calling. I also frequently leave my phone at my desk which sometimes puts me out of range to hear the phone or forces me to run to my phone just to see that it is a phone call that I don’t want to take.</description></item><item><title>iPod: The Ultimate DJ</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/09/ipod_the_ultima/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2004 16:03:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/09/ipod_the_ultima/</guid><description>More often than not I find myself feeling that my iPod knows what kind of mood I’m in. As an avid user of the Random feature I leave the DJing up to my iPod and it continually impresses me by its track selection.

I had sought to find an uncommon beer, something that was not the standard ale fare of today’s beers. Lately I have found myself craving the award winning Harpoon Winter Warmer.

When I first saw how Howard Dean was taking politics in a different direction, and using what is considered to be an unconventional political tool–the Internet–I was ultimately curious. Mainly due to that I am avidly interested in technology and beginning to question where we as Americans fit into deciding our government.</description></item><item><title>Amazon.com: Work In Progress</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/08/amazoncom_work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2004 00:28:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/08/amazoncom_work/</guid><description>I recently ordered a few books from Amazon and like many people have found them to be a great online store.

Myself, Neera, and her mom headed up to Niagara Canada to check out Niagara-on-the-Lake, the Butterfly Conservatory, and the Falls at night.
It was good to see some of the other aspects of the Niagara area since I had already seen the Falls previously. The Butterfly Conservatory was an amazing sight to see. They’re tough to get a picture of unless if you have a high speed camera.</description></item><item><title>Buffalo Trip part 1</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/buffalo_trip_pa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2004 22:17:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/buffalo_trip_pa/</guid><description>After a nasty rainstorm and a bit of traffic we finally arrived in Buffalo.
Today we headed into the city and got some chicken finger subs, a Buffalo speciality, and cruised around the city. I’ll give Buffalo credit for one thing, its got a lot of unique shops, something that is quickly fading away in Boston. Granted many of these shops only offered womens trinkets (candles, soaps, etc.).
I also got to check out Buffalo’s subway system in some degree.</description></item><item><title>Off to Buffalo</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/off_to_buffalo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2004 17:47:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/off_to_buffalo/</guid><description>Neera and I are heading out to Buffalo New York for the weekend. For the most part just a trip to hang out, get out of Boston, and for her to visit home. The big thing on my mind is the wings though. You would think that the wing recipe could be replicated, but none can come close to authentic Buffalo Wings.
Our itinerary is pretty much non-existant, which is totally fine with me.</description></item><item><title>The new age of software development</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/the_new_age_of/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2004 15:07:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/the_new_age_of/</guid><description>I’ve come across a few good articles which I think are worth reading if you are interested in software development and in particular how rich client programming is declining as web client programming is increasing.

The book clocks in at about 200 pages with a good amount of illustrations and double spaced text.
That aside I’ll say it was still a good read. The Coma plays almost like a dream analysis in terms of what make up our dreams, the setting, characters, and events. Garland constructed the book in much the way that dreams feel to me, the sudden change in scenery or the appearance of unfamiliar people as major characters.</description></item><item><title>Orbital&amp;#8217;s Blue Album</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/orbital/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2004 11:26:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/orbital/</guid><description>I’ve long been a fan of Orbital and after The Altogether I was somewhat disappointed with what Orbital had been putting out. When I heard that their next album would be their last I was hoping that they could redeem themselves.
The Blue Album is definitely a good farewell as it touches upon the progression of their sound over the years. Tracks such as One Perfect Sunrise and You Lot are just pure Orbital of old but with a bit of an updated feel.</description></item><item><title>Epicenter Design Strategies</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/epicenter_desig/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2004 13:20:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/07/epicenter_desig/</guid><description>The guys over at 37Signals always seem to come up with some good work. Their latest topic is about implementing Epicenter Design. Which they describe as:
Epicenter design involves focusing in on the true essence of the page (the â€œepicenterâ€) and then building outwards. Many times I feel that as designers we lose sight of the main goal of a particular page. We get so wrapped up in creating the right color scheme or layout that the true purpose of the page is lost.</description></item><item><title>All Consuming: Blogs put to good use</title><link>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/06/all_consuming_b/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2004 19:50:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://bryanhaggerty.com/blog/2004/06/all_consuming_b/</guid><description>A few years ago I was telling people how I felt that in the future there would be aggregator services which would search the web’s blogs and analyze them for topics such as movies, music, or books.
